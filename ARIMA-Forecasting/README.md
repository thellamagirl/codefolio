# Analyzing Revenue Data: Unveiling Insights into Customer Churn Rates in the First Two Years of Operation

## Description

This Python-based ARIMA forecasting project aims to analyze the revenue data from the first two years of operation to gain meaningful insights that can guide the company in understanding the historical cycle of churn and its implications on current customer churn rates.

Using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model, this analysis delves into the revenue patterns over the specified time frame. By applying time series analysis techniques, the project aims to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and seasonality within the revenue data. The ARIMA model proves particularly useful in capturing the dependencies and correlations present in sequential data, allowing for accurate forecasting and trend identification.

Through this project, the historical revenue data will be examined to determine its relationship with customer churn rates. By studying the revenue trends and patterns, the analysis seeks to shed light on the factors contributing to customer churn and provide actionable insights to mitigate churn in the present business landscape.

The Python programming language serves as the foundation for this project, leveraging its extensive libraries and frameworks for data manipulation, visualization, and time series analysis. In particular, the ARIMA model will be implemented using the widely-used Python libraries, matplotlib and statsmodels. These libraries provide essential functionality for conducting revenue analysis, forecasting future trends, and visualizing the results. Matplotlib enables the creation of insightful visualizations to explore the revenue data and analyze the model's performance, while statsmodels offers powerful tools for fitting the ARIMA model, evaluating its parameters, and making accurate predictions. Together, these libraries facilitate a comprehensive and robust analysis of the revenue data, enabling the extraction of valuable insights related to customer churn rates and informing data-driven decision-making processes.

Ultimately, this project aspires to empower the company with a comprehensive understanding of the historical churn cycle, enabling data-driven decision-making to reduce customer churn rates and enhance business performance.

## Installation & Setup

This project was created using Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter Notebook provides a flexible and interactive environment for coding, data analysis, documentation, and collaboration. Its versatility and ease of use make it popular among researchers, data scientists, educators, and anyone who wants to work with code and data in an interactive and reproducible manner.

For more information on installing the Anaconda Distribution and using Jupyter Notebook, visit https://www.anaconda.com/download

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thellamagirl/codefolio/tree/main/ARIMA-Forecasting
   ``` 

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ARIMA-Forecasting
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv    # Create a virtual environment. Replace "myenv" with preferred name of your environment.
   source myenv/bin/activate    # Activate the virtual environment
   ```

   This step is optional but recommended to keep your project dependencies separate from other Python installations on your system.

4. Install the required libraries and dependencies using `pip` and the provided `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This command will install all the necessary packages and their specified versions.

## Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open the ARIMA_Analysis.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook.

3. Run the notebook cells to execute the ARIMA analysis and explore the revenue data.

4. Follow the instructions and comments within the notebook to understand and interpret the analysis results.

## Configuration

The Analyzing Revenue Data project does not require any additional configuration files or settings, however, if you wish to run the project in Jupyter Notebook it will need to be installed in advance. Visit https://www.anaconda.com/download to begin.
